# birdcraft
A retake on my first site with [SDCore](https://github.com/SDCore).

## Description
BloxCraft was a site developed between me and another user.
The site was built on an early version of PHP (5.4).
This project seeks to replicate the features that BloxCraft offered with the help of the Japanese Bird, *Long-tailed tit*.

## Why Python?
The contenders for birdcraft were the following languages:
* Python (Really good choice, but limited use of language from [SDCore](https://github.com/SDCore))
* PHP (Heard PHP7 was really solid and is primarily a web framework)
* Ruby (Very sluggish, so we ruled this one out)
* Crystal (Very early builds, not really reliable)
* Node.js (I mean Javascript... is just *bad*...)

Python is just great for everything.
Flask is really cool.

## Why make this?
Because *why not*.
