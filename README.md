# birdcraft
A retake on my first site with @SDCore.

## Description
BloxCraft was a site developed between me and another user.
The site was built on an early version of PHP (5.4).
This project seeks to replicate the features that BloxCraft offered with the help of the Japanese Bird,*Long-tailed tit*.

## Why PHP?
The contenders for birdcraft were the following languages:
* Python (Really good choice, but limited use of language from @SDCore)
* PHP (Heard PHP7 was really solid and is primarily a web framework)
* Ruby (Very sluggish, so we ruled this one out)
* Crystal (Very early builds, not really reliable)
* Node.js (I mean Javascript... is just *bad*...)

We stuck with PHP because we haven't worked with the language in a very long time.
PHP7 seems like a welcome refresh with a substantial increase in performance.
We might get into Hack for some interesting "compiling" PHP but there's no point for our use case.
PHP seems to be stricter on how a user codes and sticks to a more rudimentary programming approach similar to C.
Plus the language is built **for** web programming.

## Why make this?
Because *why not*.
